# Welcome to Repad

`Repad` is a simple REverse Proxy Admin Dashboard that aims to solve a problem created through the
excessive use of Web GUIs, especially administrative ones. In contrast to regular websites,
administrative Web GUIs should not always be exposed to the world, but rather be kept behind a
firewall and only be accessed through the use of techniques like SSH tunneling.

When using multiple private Web GUIs, the management of the ports to forward might quickly become
pretty messy. This is where `Repad` comes into play. `Repad` allows you to specify proxy records
with minimal effort and provides a single dashboard to quickly access all relevant Web GUIs.
